The videos from [pgDay Paris 2019](https://2019.pgday.paris) are online, and
they look stunning! If you've been to the conference, you will be able to
enjoy great memories, and if you've not been there, you can now enjoy all
the fine content that was recorded there at the [Youtube Channel for
pgDay.Paris](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiOSEHQe91goxYNJDjj2rLw/videos).

This year at pgday Paris I tried something new. My presentation was
interactive, and I've been writing queries together with the audience,
making mistakes, loosing keystrokes and having all the fun!

The idea behind looking like a fool writing queries in front of an audience
was to show the process behind those elegant queries that we tend to share
in one piece, on a slide where they shine, beautifully indented. We don't
get to those queries writing them like we would prose. It takes multiple
iterations to get there. From something quite simple to something more and
more sophisticated, until we have exactly the result set we are interested
in.

It's the same when you integrate queries in a slide, a book, or a piece of
code. First we use an interactive tool and refine the query until it works.
Well as we would do with any other piece of code really. And then when the
SQL query is ready, we commit it to your repository right? Oh. Maybe not.
Maybe then we integrate the query in our application in a way or another.

Well, that's what the talk is all about, the process behing how to write SQL
queries.
