      <description>Photo by unsplash-logoHanna Morris  Postgres Query Planning PostgreSQL provides advanced tooling to understand how it executes SQL queries. The execution of a query follows specific steps:
 Parsing Planning Optimization Execution   When it comes to the execution step, all Postgres does is follow the selected optimized plan. It is possible to ask Postgres for the query plan and inspect it, in order to better understand the execution of any query and then when necessary find a way to execute the same query faster.</description>

      <title>Compute database size</title>

      <description>Photo by unsplash-logoCharles üáµüá≠  It is well known that database design should be as simple as possible, and follow the normalization process. Except in some cases, sometimes, for scalability purposes. Partitioning might be used to help deal with large amount of data for instance.
But what is a large amount of data? Do you need to pay attention to those scalability trade-offs now, or can you wait until later?</description>

A great deal of thinking have been put in the ordering of the parts, so that reading ‚ÄúThe Art of PostgreSQL‚Äù in a linear fashion should provide the best experience.</description>

   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a very popular question to ask these days, it seems. The quick answer
is easy and is the slogan of PostgreSQL, as seen on the community website
for it: ‚ÄúPostgreSQL: The World&amp;rsquo;s Most Advanced Open Source Relational
Database‚Äù. What does that mean for you, the developer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my recent article &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/blog/2019-09-postgresopen/&#34;&gt;The Art of PostgreSQL: The Transcript, part I
&lt;/a&gt; you will read why I
think it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to use Postgres in your application&amp;rsquo;s stack. My
conference talk addresses the main area where I think many people get it
wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Learn SQL?</title>
      <link>https://theartofpostgresql.com/blog/2019-09-how-to-learn-sql/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2019 00:15:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://theartofpostgresql.com/blog/2019-09-how-to-learn-sql/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here we are, another SQL query to write. You wish you knew how to write that
mechanically, like you would a loop in your favorite programming language.
Or at least have a pretty clear idea of a skeleton to tweak until it gives
the result set you expect. So instead of working on your SQL query, you
google &lt;a href=&#34;#&#34;&gt;How to write a SQL query?&lt;/a&gt; or maybe even &lt;a href=&#34;#&#34;&gt;How to learn SQL?&lt;/a&gt;
Right. I feel you, I&amp;rsquo;ve been there too, even if quite some time ago‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here my article where I teach you how to learn SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to share with you how I did it, and how I continue to do it. There&amp;rsquo;s
no magic secret sauce to it though, it&amp;rsquo;s all basic work. Again, we have to
learn the main concepts and how they play together, then practice simple
steps, and then build from there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The R in ORM</title>
      <link>https://theartofpostgresql.com/blog/2019-09-the-r-in-orm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, I like SQL. A lot. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a fine DSL given how
powerful it is, and I respect its initial goal to attract non developers and
try to build English sentences rather than code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I understand that manually hydrating your collection of objects in
your backend developement language is not the best use of your time. And
that building SQL as strings makes your code ugly. I get it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is an SQL Aggregate?</title>
      <link>https://theartofpostgresql.com/blog/2019-09-sql-aggregates/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2019 22:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://theartofpostgresql.com/blog/2019-09-sql-aggregates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our previous articles we had a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://theartofpostgresql.com/blog/2019-09-sql-relations/&#34;&gt;What is an SQL
relation?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://theartofpostgresql.com/blog/2019-09-sql-joins/&#34;&gt;What is a SQL
JOIN?&lt;/a&gt;. Today, I want to show you what is an
aggregate in SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have heard about Map/Reduce when Google made it famous, or maybe
some years before, or maybe some years later. The general processing
functions &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; where invented a very long time ago. The
novelty from the advertising giant was in using them in a heavily
distributed programming context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; you apply the same processing to every object in a collection.
With &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;, you compute a result per collection of object. In SQL we know
how to do that too, and we call that an aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is an SQL JOIN?</title>
      <link>https://theartofpostgresql.com/blog/2019-09-sql-joins/</link>

      <guid>https://theartofpostgresql.com/blog/2019-09-sql-joins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It took me quite some time before I could reason efficiently about SQL
JOINs. And I must admit, the set theory diagrams never helped me really
understand JOINs in SQL. So today, I want to help you understand JOINs in a
different way, hoping to make the concept click at once for you too!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, understanding SQL is taking you a long time. And some
efforts. It took me years to get a good mental model of how SQL queries are
implemented, and then up from the lower levels, to build a mental model of
how to reason in SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, in most case, I can think in terms of SQL and write queries that
will give me the result set I need. In most cases, because some parts of SQL
are still complex, and I don&amp;rsquo;t practice as much as I used to. In particular,
newer PostgreSQL features are areas I still need to work with more before I
can integrate them in my daily workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to introduce the central concept of the SQL language. What is
an SQL relation?&lt;/p&gt;
