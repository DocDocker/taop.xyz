  <h3>What is a LEFT JOIN in SQL?</h3>
  <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
   <div itemprop="text">
    SQL allows developers to manipulate <b>relations</b>. A <b>JOIN</b> is
    an operation that builds a new relation, dynamically, from two other
    relations. A <b>LEFT JOIN</b> builds the new relation by associating 0
    or more rows from the second input relation to every row from the first
    relation.
